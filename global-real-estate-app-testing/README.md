# Global Real Estate App: Business Platform & Workflow Testing

## Project Description
A professional B2B real estate platform designed for agents, providing access to international off-plan property data, payment structures, and marketing resources. The system enables agents to generate instant sales proposals (as links or PDFs), manage resale transactions between partners, and build networks of verified professionals.

## My Testing Process & Strategy
My testing focused on validating the core workflows that real estate agents depend on for their daily business operations:

**User Account & Profile Management:** Executed end-to-end testing of the user lifecycle, including registration, login/logout functionality, and profile customizationâ€”specifically verifying the upload and display of profile pictures and videos.

**Document & Resource Management:** Verified the creation, organization, and deletion of folders within the platform, ensuring agents could reliably manage their marketing materials and client documents.

**Referral & Partnership System:** Tested the generation and functionality of referral links, a critical feature for building partner networks and tracking commission-based collaborations.

**Core Feature Sanity Testing:** Conducted validation of key platform features including property search filters, data presentation for off-plan projects, and access to payment plan information.

## Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned

**Understanding B2B Application Complexity:** Gained insight into testing platforms where the user is a professional, requiring a focus on efficiency, data accuracy, and features that directly impact business revenue.

**Data Integrity is Paramount:** In a real estate context, the accuracy of payment plans, project data, and client information is non-negotiable. This reinforced the importance of rigorous validation in data-heavy applications.

**The Importance of Configurable Workflows:** Testing features like "instant offers" highlighted the need to validate not just if a feature works, but if it works flexibly according to different user inputs and business scenarios.
