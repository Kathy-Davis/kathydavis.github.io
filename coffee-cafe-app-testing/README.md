**Coffee Cafe App: End-to-End Workflow & UI Validation**

Project Description:
A full-featured web application for a coffee cafe, combining e-commerce food ordering with restaurant reservation management. The platform allows users to browse menus, place delivery orders, and book tablesâ€”all within a single integrated system.

**My Testing Process & Strategy:**

**My testing strategy employed a multi-layered approach to ensure both functional reliability and UI compliance:**

**Smoke Testing & Core Navigation:** Initially verified critical pathways to ensure the application was stable for deeper testing, particularly focusing on accessing the main menu and cart functionality.

**Shopping Cart Validation (25 Test Cases):** Executed a comprehensive test suite around cart functionality, including: adding/removing items, quantity updates, price calculations, persistent cart data, and integration with the checkout process.

**UI Compliance & Accessibility Testing:** Meticulously validated the application against a 100-page Product Requirements Document (PRD), using Chrome DevTools to verify font types, sizes, spacing, and color schemes met exact specifications.

**Negative Testing Scenarios:** Designed tests to break expected workflows, including invalid form entries, edge cases for quantity selection, and testing error handling mechanisms.

**Cross-Device Compatibility:** Tested the screen rotation feature and responsive design to ensure consistent user experience across different device orientations and sizes.

**Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned:**

**Bridging PRD to Reality:** Gained invaluable experience translating extensive written requirements into actionable, precise test cases, ensuring pixel-perfect UI implementation.

**The Critical Role of Negative Testing:** Confirmed that some of the most valuable bugs are found by intentionally trying to break happy-path scenarios, especially in user-input areas like the shopping cart.

**DevTools as a Testing Powerhouse:** Mastered using Chrome DevTools not just for debugging, but as an active testing tool for compliance and validation against strict design standards.
